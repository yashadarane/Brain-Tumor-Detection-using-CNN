# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
This project uses a fine-tuned VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify brain MRI scans into different tumor categories. The interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to randomly select and visualize predictions along with interpretability maps like Grad-CAM Heatmaps and Saliency Maps
